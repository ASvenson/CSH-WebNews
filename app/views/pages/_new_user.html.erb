  <h2>Welcome to WebNews!</h2>
  
  <p>Your WebNews account has been created and you're all set to party like it's 1987. If you find yourself wondering about news etiquette or what each newsgroup is for, the <a href="https://wiki.csh.rit.edu/wiki/News">wiki page on News</a> has you covered.</p>
  
  <p>All posts up to this moment have been marked read for you. Newsgroups with unread posts will appear <span class="unread">bold</span>. You can quickly jump through your unread posts using the <b>Next Unread</b> button or by pressing the <span class="keyboard">n</span> key (check the <b>?</b> button in the upper-right for the full list of hotkeys).</p>
  
  <p>By default, <i>all</i> new posts made from this point on (except those in control.cancel and csh.test) will be marked unread for you. To change this and other options, use the <b>Settings</b> button in the upper-right.</p>
