  <h2>Welcome to WebNews!</h2>
  
  <p>Your WebNews account has been created and you're all set to party like it's 1987. If you find yourself wondering about news etiquette or what each newsgroup is for, the <a href="https://wiki.csh.rit.edu/wiki/News">wiki page on News</a> has you covered.</p>
  
  <p>All posts up to this moment have been marked read for you. Newsgroups with unread posts will appear <span class="unread">bold</span>: You can quickly jump through your unread posts using the <b>Next Unread</b> button in the toolbar.</p>
  
  <p>Posts, newsgroups, and the Home dashboard all use a common color code:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="unread mine">Your posts</li>
    <li class="unread mine_reply">Direct replies to your posts</li>
    <li class="unread mine_in_thread">Posts in a thread you've participated in</li>
  </ul>
